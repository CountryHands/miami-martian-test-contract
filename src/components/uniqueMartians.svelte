		Word travels fast… Especially when you're telepathic. As everyone on Earth seems to be flocking
		down to Miami, us Martians have decided to take up residence as well. Along with our presence,
		our mission is to establish a digital kinship whose connection extends beyond the physical
		plane.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-5">
		The Miami Martian Club features a collection of 10,000 Martian NFTs. These Martians are digital
		collectibles that will provide both physical and monetary value, especially for those located in
		Miami.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-5">
		Miami Martians can be found partying, discussing investments, or collaborating to develop the
		integrity of their community. Being a part of the Miami Martian Club is no small feat. The
		essence of our community is to bring together individuals who work hard and play harder, while
		also being entrusted with the responsibility of self-governance and collective leadership. Oh
		yeah… and to party. You see, us martians don’t wait in lines, nor do we pay for tables at
		nightclubs. Wishing you could do the same? Miami Martian Club members can expect guest list
		access, VIP treatment, and member only events at nightclubs and venues across Miami.
