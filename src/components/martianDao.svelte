            A 10% royalty will be collected on all Martian sales in the secondary market. This means
            that when Martians are traded in the secondary market, 10% of that sale price is collected
            back. These royalties collected in the secondary trading market will be used to fuel the
            Martian treasury. This treasury is to be governed by the community of holders. Martian
            Holders will be granted access to the Martian DAO. Each Martian held is equal to one vote.
            Holders will be able to create proposals and vote on these proposals as to how the Martian
            treasury is invested, spent or dispersed. If invested, all profits will be redistributed
            among holders. If spent, Martian holders will vote as to what experiences the treasury will
            be spent to create. If dispersed, holders can decide on what schedule they would like the
            treasury to be dispersed back to the holders. For specific questions concerning the DAO,
            please visit our Discord server.
